# Image Matcher
 Finds and sorts images in a dataset relative to their similarity with an input image using the algorithm described in [Color Indexing, Swain & Ballard, 1991](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/av/LECTURE_NOTES/swainballard91.pdf).
 
 This algorithm finds similarities between images by creating a histogram for each of the color channels and comparing each images' histograms by computing their distance using one of two different techniques that can be chosen during runtime.
 
 I worked on this project as part of my Bsc in Computer Science at Universit√© Paris Descartes.
